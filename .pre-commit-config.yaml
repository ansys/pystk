    # HACK: pre-commit is used during the code-style job in CI/CD. This job
    # executes `pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure`.
    # As per this issue https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/2936,
    # it looks like the `--all-files` only listens for the `exclude` option in a
    # pre-commit hook, ignoring `pyproject.toml` excludes.

    # TODO: pre-commit seems to ignore the configuration declared for codespell
    # in the `pyproject.toml` file. For more details, see `[tool.codespell]` in
    # the `pyproject.toml` file.
