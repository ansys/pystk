ORGANIZATION of COMPACT DISC, and FILE STRUCTURES

   A. Directory Organization

At the highest level, there are three directories and one file.
The directories are:  DTED, GAZETTE, and TEXT.  DTED is the only
one containing subdirectories.  The one file is DMED.

      1. Subdirectory Naming

Within the DTED directory, there is a subdirectory for each
longitude containing cells.  The subdirectory name format is:
<E/W>DDD
where DDD is degrees.  For example, the subdirectory name for
DTED files contained between the meridians 127E and 128E would
be:  E127

      2. File Naming

The DTED cell file name format is: <N/S>DD.DT1 where DD is
degrees.  For example, the file name for a DTED cell whose
southwest corner is 38N and 127E would be:

     N38.DT1, or starting from the root, \DTED\E127\N38.DT1


   B. DTED Cell Format

A Level 1 DTED cell is a single file containing the following
information obtained from the standard DMA DTED distribution
format with the following changes: VOL1, HDR1, EOF1, UTL1, and
hardware end of file marks are not included in the file.

                                                   Starting Byte
(1) User Header Label (UHL: 80 bytes)                       1
(2) Data Set Identification Record (DSI: 648 bytes)        81
(3) Accuracy Record (ACC: 2700 bytes)*                    729
(4) Data Records (1201 records at 2414                   3429,5843,
    bytes/record)**                                      8257,etc.

* To meet current distribution security requirements of producing
only unclassified CD DTED, when there are multiple accuracy
subregions they are left blank (bytes 58-2613 of the ACC record)
and the multiple accuracy outline flag is set to 10 (bytes 56-57
of the ACC record).

** The number of records is a function of the latitude.  A count
of 1201 is for cells between latitudes S50 and N49 degrees.
There are no sparse cells.  Elevations are two-byte integers,
high order first, and negatives are signed magnitude.  Users may
have to switch the bytes and convert negatives to the complement
they use.  This can be done by putting the low order byte first,
then turning off bit 15 (the high order bit), then multiplying by
-1.  For positive numbers, only the bytes are switched.

   C. DMED File. \DMED

The Digital Mean Elevation Data (DMED) file is a series of
394-byte records.  The first record is a header giving the
extremes of the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) (in degrees)
encompassing the cells on the CD.  For example, N30N36E020E032
followed by 380 spaces indicates that the MBR is 6 degrees high
and 12 degrees wide.  The next record has the data for the
extreme southwest 1-degree cell in the MBR.  The third record is
for the 1-degree cell above that, and so forth, to the top of the
MBR.  Moving eastwardly, and until the edge of the MBR is
reached, the next column of cells is added to the file, with
placement being from south to north.  If a cell in the MBR is not
on the CD, its DMED record consists of its coordinates followed
by 387 spaces (ASCII blanks).  A record gives the cell's
southwest corner, the data edition number and match/merge version
of the cell from which the DMED is calculated, and the following
information about each 15' x 15' area of the cell: minimum and
maximum elevations, mean elevation and standard deviation of the
elevations.  Data are all upper-case ASCII characters.  Elevation
values are to the nearest meter.  In a 1-degree cell, the
elevations in the three rows and three columns which divide the
15' x 15' areas from each other are counted in two areas.

The order in which the 16 areas of a cell follow the header is:

                 4 8 12 16
                 3 7 11 15
                 2 6 10 14
                 1 5  9 13

   D. Gazette Directory
In the gazette directory are files GAZETTE.KEY and GAZETTE.DIR,
plus two files for each gazette (country) with the name
convention <country>.GAZ and <country>.HSH.  The country name may
be abbreviated.  If the minimum bounding rectangle of a CD
touches any country, the entire gazetteer for that country is
included, resulting possibly in coordinates extraneous to the
geographic coverage.

      1. <country>.GAZ
This is the primary file.  It consists of variable length ASCII
alphanumeric records, one entry for each name.  Alphabetic
characters are upper case.  Each record consists of a designation
code in bytes 1-4, the latitude in bytes 5-11 (DDMMSSN/S), the
longitude in bytes 12-19 (DDDMMSSE/W), a space in byte 20, and a
variable length name field starting in byte 21.  The name field
contains a name, or a name followed by "SEE" followed by another
name.  The name field is followed by a carriage return (CR), a
line feed (LF), then the next record.  Even though most
coordinates are rounded to the nearest minute, seconds are
included in the format to accommodate future data.  The seconds
contain the digits 00.  Entries are ordered by the ASCII
collating sequence of the names.

      2. <country>.HSH

This is the hash, or index, file.  The hash file is a convenience
for the user who wants a quick pointer into the primary file.  It
consists of four-byte records which are 32-bit integers (high
byte first).  It is based on the first three or four characters
of the names in the primary file.  Three characters are used for
gazetteers with less than 50,000 entries, and four are used for
larger ones.  The binary integer in bytes 1-4 of the hash file
tells how many characters were used.  Characters considered for
the computation are given in the following table along with the
hexadecimal ASCII value and the decimal hash value.  All other
characters take the value of the space.

           Character   ASCII   Hash

           space       20      0
           '           27      1
           ,           2C      2

           grave       60      32
           tilde       7E      33

Assuming a 4-character hash, to find a record in the primary file
you compute the value of the first four characters of a
geographic name, go to that record number in the hash file, read
an address, and go to that byte number in the primary file.
From there you read records sequentially until you find the
desired place name.   To compute the value of 4 characters, give
each a value of 0-33 (see table above), then multiply the
first by 34**3, the second by 34**2, the third by 34, and the
fourth by 1, then add the values and +2 together.  EXAMPLE: WRAN
= 28x39304 + 23x1156 + 6x34 + 19x1 + 2 = 1127325.  Assume that
hash record number 1127325 is the integer 4023300.  In the
primary file read the record starting at byte 4023300, and read
down the file by records until finding WRANGEL BAY, or one of the
islands.  The first byte of the file is byte one, not zero.  In
the 3-character scheme multiply the first three characters by
34**2, 34**1, and 1.

      3. GAZETTE.KEY
The key file is a dictionary of the 4-letter designation codes.
It is a text file of variable length records with designation
code in bytes 1-4, space in 5, variable length explanation, and
CR LF.

      4. GAZETTE.DIR
This text file gives the abbreviated country names, and expands
them to their full length.

   E. Text Directory

      1. READ.ME

An ASCII text file named READ.ME, contains a description of the
disc contents including the geographic limits of the compact
disc, a count of the cells, a location diagram (text array)
showing which cells in the minimum bounding rectangle are
resident on the disc, and a user's guide.

       2. ONC.DIR

ONC.DIR is an ASCII file that provides, via ONC tiles, a
directory to the DTED cells on the CD-ROM.
