# File format is as follows:
# If first character of a line is '#' the entire line is treated as a comment line.
# First non-comment line is file format version.  Tells STK the format of the remaining file.
# Second non-comment line is a sampling mode.  Only "SampleAndHold" is supported (future will bring more options).
# Remaining non-comment lines are time specified pointing directions with the following format:
#   <time>  1  <direction 1 Az>  <direction l El> where only 1 direction is currently supported for the beam directions and 
#   Az/El are in degrees and in Antenna's body reference frame.
