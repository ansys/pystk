            * - :py:attr:`~L1`
              - A point between the Sun and Earth.

            * - :py:attr:`~L2`
              - Similar to L2, but on the night side of Earth, further away from the Sun, but about the same distane from Earth.

            * - :py:attr:`~L3`
              - L3 lies on a line defined by the Sun and Earth, on the opposite side of the Sun, just outside the orbit of Earth. L3 remains hidden behind the Sun at all times.

            * - :py:attr:`~L4`
              - The L4 and L5 points lie at 60 degrees ahead of and behind Earth in its orbit as seen from the Sun. L4 and L5 are \"stable\" points.

            * - :py:attr:`~L5`
              - The L4 and L5 points lie at 60 degrees ahead of and behind Earth in its orbit as seen from the Sun. L4 and L5 are \"stable\" points.
