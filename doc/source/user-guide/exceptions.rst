PySTK exceptions
################

In PySTK, exceptions are used to signal errors or unexpected conditions that arise during the execution of a script. When working with the API, you may encounter situations where something goes wrong, such as trying to access a non-existent object, providing invalid input, or encountering a runtime error while manipulating your scenario. Exceptions provide a mechanism for handling these errors in a controlled and predictable way.

The table below describes the exceptions that are provided by the agi.stk12.utilities.exceptions module with PySTK.
