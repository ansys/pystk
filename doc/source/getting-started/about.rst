About
#####

PySTK is the next generation Python API for Ansys Systems Toolkit (STK). Its main advantages and features over previous APIs include:

- **Remotable API using gRPC**: In addition to traditional OLE communication
  with STK, the STK Python API has optional gRPC communication for
  out-of-process or remote interaction with STK.

- **Better namings:** API objects no longer have prefixes in their
  class names and methods. This improves readability, making your code easy to
  read and to maintain.

- **PyAnsys compliance:** the API integrates with the rest of the `PyAnsys`_,
  allowing users to interconect Ansys products via their Python APIs.


Historical background
=====================

Historically interacting with STK Desktop and STK Engine from Python has been
achieved using the `win32com`_ or `comtypes`_ Python modules. With the release
of STK 12.1, Python wrappers were auto-generated by using `ctypes`_ to directly
call shared libraries.
