            * - :py:attr:`~BLOW_DOWN`
              - Blow-Down - pressure decreases as propellant is consumed and the volume occupied by the pressurant gas consequently increases. This is based on the ideal gas law.

            * - :py:attr:`~PRESSURE_REGULATED`
              - Pressure-Regulated - constant pressure is maintained in the fuel tank through some pressurization mechanism as the propellant mass decreases.
